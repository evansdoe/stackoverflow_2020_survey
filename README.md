## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The Python libraries necessary to execute the codes in the Jupyter Notebook are
as follows:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)

Alternatively, installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
should be enough to run the codes in the Jupyter Notebook.

In addition, one will need the following datasets:
* [Stack Overflow 2020 survey dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dfGerWeWkcyQ9GX9x20rdSGj7WtEpzBB/view?usp=sharing)
* [Population dataset for the year 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/tanuprabhu/population-by-country-2020) — available on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) created by [Tanu N Prabhu](https://www.kaggle.com/tanuprabhu).
* [Country continent dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/statchaitya/country-to-continent) — available on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) created by [Chaitanya Gokhale](https://www.kaggle.com/statchaitya).

downloaded into the directory that the Jupyter Notebook is saved.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this project I used the given datasets mentioned in the [Installation](#installation)
to give relevant answers to the following questions: 

1. How does the distribution of the respondents in the survey correspond to their  
countries (resp. continents) and whether the distribution well represent the 
population of the countries (resp. continents)?

2. What are the most popular database environments (that are currently being 
  worked on, and desired to be work in over the next year) among the respondents 
  in the survey as well as those in countries that are mostly represented?

3. What are the most popular collaboration tools (that are currently being 
  worked on, and desired to be work in over the next year) among the respondents 
  in the survey as well as those in countries that are mostly represented?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/evansdoe/stackoverflow_2020_survey/blob/main/stackoverflow_2020_survey.ipynb) available including complete study on above questions.

There is only one Jupyter notebook assigned to this project whereby all the 
questions mentioned in the [Project Motivation](#motivation) section are answered.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main results of my analysis can be found at the post available [here](put-link-to-analysis-of-the-results-here).
